    "Bacterial spot is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas vesicatoria. Instead of attaching red tomatoes, this bacteria targets green tomatoes, as well as peppers. It’s more common to experience bacterial spot during wet seasons with excess rain and humidity.The bacteria survive winter on infected plant debris and other plants, so you must remove as much plant debris as possible at the end of the growing season. It loves and thrives in moist weather. Most bacterial spot outbreaks are due to heavy rainstorms that cause the bacteria to find open wounds on the leaves.",
    "Chances are you’ve heard of blight. There are two forms: early and late. Alternaria solani is the fungus that causes early blight.Early blight lives in the soil throughout the winter, which is why it’s best to change locations for your tomato plants. If they had early blight in the previous years and didn’t rotate crops, they’ll contract it again from the soil’s fungus. It lives for years!",
    "This is one of the most common tomato plant diseases is light blight, caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans. Late blight appears during cool, rainy periods that most often happen at the end of a growing season. This plant disease is no joke; it affects all parts of the plant. Complete defoliation of the tomato plant happens within 14 days after the first symptoms, so watching your plants closely is key to stopping the disease before it gets too bad.",
    "Here is another fungal disease that infects tomato plants. Fulvia fulva is the fungus that causes leaf mold, and it loves to grow in places with poor air circulation and high humidity levels. That’s why it’s most commonly found on tomatoes grown in greenhouses.",
    "Here is another fungal disease that might take over your plants. A fungus called Septoria lycopersici leads to this infection that takes over and infects the plant’s foliage. Like many fungal infections, Septoria Leaf Spot primarily happens when watering the plants.",
    "The tomato red spider mites are pale-orange to red and feed on the underside of leaves. They cannot be seen easily with the naked eye. Feeding damage caused by sucking sap appears as many shiny pale yellow marks on the top of the tomato leaf.",
    "Target spot of tomato often causes necrotic lesions in a concentric pattern, similar to early blight. Target spot of tomato is favored by temperatures of 68 to 82°F and leaf wetness periods as long as 16 hours. The target spot fungus can survive in host residue for a period.",
    "Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) is not seed-borne but is transmitted by whiteflies. This disease is extremely damaging to fruit yield in both tomato and pepper crops. Whiteflies may bring the disease into the garden from infected weeds nearby, such as various nightshades and jimsonweed. After infection, tomato plants may be symptomless for as long as 2 to 3 weeks.",
    "The Mosaic Virus attacks tomato plants, as well as a range of other vegetable plants. This virus doesn’t kill most plants, but it can reduce the number of fruits produced and their quality. That means all your hard work might go down the drain.Open wounds in the leaves and stems allow the virus to enter, so avoid handling the plants. That’s especially true if you smoke because tobacco harbors the mosaic virus. ",

prevention = ["It’s hard to prevent and control bacterial spot when it appears in your garden. The bacteria spread by water, splashing from one plant to another. Avoiding overhead watering is the first step; using drip irrigation is essential around tomato plants."
"1) Prune Your Plants : It’s essential to prune your plants to encourage good air circulation."
"2) Spray a Copper Fungicide :  The best way to treat bacterial spot organically is to spray your plants with copper fungicide. It’s effective at controlling this bacterial disease.",
              "Getting rid of early blight is more challenging than you might imagine. Here is what you can try."

"1) Use Proper Plant Care Recommendations"
"Using proper care and gardening techniques is the best way to prevent late blight. Rotate crops, clear away debris and weeds, and space tomato plants appropriately for air circulation. Always water tomato plants at the base, not on the stem."

"2) An Organic Fungicide"
"Look for a brand of fungicides that is compliant with organic gardening. One option is called Safer; look at your local garden center for other choices. Garden fungicides can treat plants infected with early blight. "

"3) Use Liquid Copper Fungicide"
"Another option is to spray the plant with liquid copper fungicide concentrate. It’s an organic treatment that needs to be done on a dry day. The next time, remove the lower branches and repeat the treatment in one to two weeks.",
              "Getting rid of late blight is tricky, so the first steps are to prevent the disease. Purchase certified disease-free plants and seeds and keep your garden beds cleared out to remove debris that might harbor disease."

"1) Water Properly"
"It’s wise to water adequately. Keep the foliage dry and water the base of the plant only. Overhead watering spreads diseases even more. When planting, provide extra room between the tomato plants; air circulation reduces diseases. "

"2) Pull Out Plants"
"Plants infected with late blight often needed to be pulled out of the garden and destroyed. Don’t compost them; they should be trashed or burned." 

"3) Use Copper Fungicide"
"In some cases, a copper fungicide can be applied and used to treat late blight effectively.",
"Preventing leaf mold is like many other fungal diseases. Improving air circulation and using proper watering techniques are essential. Always stake your tomato plants to increase airflow and avoid getting water on the leaves."

"1) Use an Appropriate Fungicide "
"One of the most common leaf mold treatments is to use a preventative fungicide that contains chlorothalonil or copper fungicide.",
              "Getting rid of Septoria Leaf Spot is a bit tricky; it’s best to focus on preventative measures, such as proper watering techniques and leaving room between plants for air circulation. If your plants end up infected anyway, here are some suggestions."

"1) Rotate Crops"
"Always practice crop rotation to reduce the inoculum. Removing crop debris is an essential part of crop rotation and decreases the risk of the disease living in the soil for years." 

"2) Use a Garden Fungicide"
"With this fungus, you also can use an organic fungicide as a treatment. Spray the foliage and entire plant at least one time to kill off the spores. Copper fungicides or those containing chlorothalonil are most effective.",
"Chemical pesticide use actually encourages the spread of spider mites by killing the beneficial insects that prey on them. Mites are also known to develop quick resistance to various pesticides. For these reasons, it’s important to control mites with effective natural and organic methods."

"Prune leaves, stems and other infested parts of plants well past any webbing and discard in trash (and not in compost piles). Don’t be hesitant to pull entire plants to prevent the mites spreading to its neighbors."
"Use the Bug Blaster to wash plants with a strong stream of water and reduce pest numbers."
"Commercially available beneficial insects, such as ladybugs, lacewing and predatory mites are important natural enemies. For best results, make releases when pest levels are low to medium."
"Nuke Em, a relatively new organic insecticide containing food-grade ingredients, works fast and kills most indoor gardening pests at the egg, larvae or adult stage. Best of all, it does this without leaving a residue on the leaves that can impact flavor."
"BotaniGard ES is a highly effective biological insecticide containing Beauveria bassiana, an entomopathogenic fungus that attacks a long-list of troublesome crop pests – even resistant strains! Weekly applications can prevent insect population explosions and provide protection equal to or better than conventional chemical pesticides."
"Mix Pure Neem Oil with Coco-Wet and apply every 3-5 days to kill pest eggs indoors and interrupt the reproductive cycle. Make sure to spray all plant parts, including the undersides of leaves. Do NOT apply when temperatures exceed 90˚F and wait at last six hours before turning lights on."
"If populations are high, use a least-toxic, short-lived pesticide (Take Down Spray, Doktor Doom Foggers) to reduce infestations, then release predatory mites to maintain control."
"Insecticidal soap or botanical insecticides can be used to spot treat heavily infested areas."
"On fruit trees, horticultural oil should be applied early in the season or late in the fall to destroy overwintering eggs."
"Dust on leaves, branches and fruit encourages mites. A mid-season hosing (or two!) to remove dust from trees is a worthwhile preventative."
"Water stress makes both trees and garden plants more susceptible to mite infestations. Make sure your plants are properly watered.",
"Before planting:"

"Do not plant new crops next to older ones that have the disease."
"Plant as far as possible from papaya, especially if leaves have small angular spots (Photo 5)."
"Check all seedlings in the nursery, and throw away any with leaf spots."
"During growth:"

"Remove a few branches from the lower part of the plants to allow better airflow at the base"
"Remove and burn the lower leaves as soon as the disease is seen, especially after the lower fruit trusses have been picked."
"Keep plots free from weeds, as some may be hosts of the fungus."
"Do not use overhead irrigation; otherwise, it will create conditions for spore production and infection."
"After harvest:"

"Collect and burn as much of the crop as possible when the harvest is complete."
"Practise crop rotation, leaving 3 years before replanting tomato on the same land."
"RESISTANT VARIETIES"
"Trials have been done in Solomon Islands with lines of tomatoes from AVRDC (now known as The World Vegetable Center). One variety has been released and this has some tolerance to the disease, BUT is not resistant. It has the number CLN2585D."

"CHEMICAL CONTROL"
"Warm wet conditions favour the disease such that fungicides are needed to give adequate control. The products to use are chlorothalonil, copper oxychloride or mancozeb. Treatment should start when the first spots are seen and continue at 10-14-day intervals until 3-4 weeks before last harvest. It is important to spray both sides of the leaves.",
              "Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV), a disease that threatens both commercial tomato production fields and home gardens, was identified in March 2007 by Dr. Robert Gilbertson, University of California, Davis (UCD), in greenhouse tomato samples from Brawley, Calif."

"TYLCV is transmitted by adult silverleaf whiteflies and can spread rapidly, but TYLCV is not transmitted through seed or by mechanical transmission. The presence of silverleaf whitefly host plants, both cultivated (peppers and tomatoes) or wild hosts (sowthistle, cheeseweed and nightshade weeds) during spring and summer may lead to whitefly migration and spread of TYLCV. During late spring, summer, and early fall, growers need to monitor whitefly populations very closely and destroy whitefly weed hosts and crop residues (melons and cotton). TYLCV has a broad host range from several plant families including Solanaceae (tomato, peppers, various nightshade weeds, and ornamental plants), Malvaceae (cheeseweed), and Fabaceae (beans)."

"Typical symptoms for this disease in tomato are yellow (chlorotic) leaf edges, upward leaf cupping, leaf mottling, reduced leaf size, and flower drop. TYLCV can have a severe impact on tomato production. Plants infected at an early stage won't bear fruit and their growth will be severely stunted."

"TYLCV identification based only on symptomatology is unreliable, because similar symptoms can be caused by other viruses or various growing conditions."

"Use only virus-and whitefly-free tomato and pepper transplants. Transplants should be treated with Capture (bifenthrin) or Venom (dinotefuran) for whitefly adults and Oberon for eggs and nymphs. Imidacloprid or thiamethoxam should be used in transplant houses at least seven days before shipping. Transplants should be produced in areas well away from tomato and pepper production fields."

"Use a neonicotinoid insecticide, such as dinotefuran (Venom) imidacloprid (AdmirePro, Alias, Nuprid, Widow, and others) or thiamethoxam (Platinum), as a soil application or through the drip irrigation system at transplanting of tomatoes or peppers. After the efficacy of the neonicotinoid insecticide application begins to decline, the secondary spread of whiteflies will need to be controlled. Monitor whitefly populations throughout the season, treating when present. Rotate insecticide classes for insecticide resistance management (IRM). Foliar insecticide treatments used in IRM for whitefly control include: Capture, a pyrethroid; foliar neonicotinoid insecticides dinotefuran (Venom), imidacloprid (Provado), and thiamethoxam (Actara), but do not use if a neonicotinoid insecticide was applied as a soil or drip irrigation treatment; insect growth regulators such as pyriproxyfen (Knack) and buprofezin (Courier); insecticidal soap; and crop oils. A highly UV-reflective mulch (metalized) and low rates of crop oil (0.25 -0.50 percent) can be used as whitefly repellents to reduce whitefly feeding and virus transmission."

"Sanitation is very important for preventing the migration of whitefly adults and the spread of TYLCV. Rogue tomato or pepper plants with early symptoms of TYLCV can be removed from fields by placing infected-looking plants in plastic bags immediately at the beginning season, especially during first three to four weeks. Maintain good weed control in the field and surrounding areas. Prevent the spread of any whiteflies to healthy plants. Tomato and pepper fields should be cleaned up immediately after harvest. Also destroy crop residues of melons and cotton immediately after harvest to reduce whitefly migration.",
"Since this is a viral disease, there is no cure for a virus, and every effort should be made to prevent it from taking over in your garden. Using fungicides will be of help treating this virus, and don’t save seeds from infected crops."

"Here’s how to prevent the mosaic virus."

"1) Treat with Neem Oil"
"Several insects carry the mosaic virus, so pre-treating your plants regularly with neem oil and other natural pest control products can help ward off the insects." 

"2) Use Row Covers"
"Another trick to keep insects off of your plants is to cover your tomato plants with row covers. These will keep the pests off your vulnerable plants. "

"3) Always Clean Garden Tools"
"This virus often spreads by garden tools. Always disinfect garden tools, ties, pots, and any other equipment with a solution that is one part bleach hand four parts water. ",
